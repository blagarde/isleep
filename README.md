An Android app to learn while you sleep.

This project is currently no more than an Android app that reads from your device and dumps to CSV.

My friend Matt wants to make an app that helps memorize what you studied by playing back your lessons in your sleep.
Apparently, if you sleep with your smartphone, the accelerometer data can be used to infer sleep cycles.

I wrote this so he can start capturing data and designing sleep models.
